0            It's a pond.\n \n      Schopelo said his\n      friend lives here.

1            I can't pass\n          these rocks.

2        There's nothing\n      beneath the soil.

3      What is this door?

4  This rock was pushed.

5         I should hurry\n         to see Ninya.

6      Is this the airship\n  Melkinso mentioned?

7            It's locked.

8         It's the airship\n          from before.

10      I recovered health!

11   I took the guide map.

12             I took the\n   low-grade synthester

13    I took the silver key.

14       I took the broom.

15          I don't need to\n     go down anymore.
